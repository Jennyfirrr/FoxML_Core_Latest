   Derivative Work, less only sales taxes and government-mandated fees.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

   Upon execution of a commercial license agreement and payment of all
   applicable fees, the Copyright Holder grants the Licensee a non-exclusive,
   non-transferable (except as set forth in Section 6), worldwide, revocable
   license to:

   a) Use and modify the Software for internal business purposes;
   b) Deploy the Software as part of the Licensee's products and services,
      including network/SaaS deployments, without the source-disclosure
      obligations of the AGPL-3.0;
   c) Distribute the Software solely as an integrated component of the
      Licensee's larger proprietary works (not as a standalone product);
   d) Create Derivative Works for the Licensee's own use and deployment.

3. RESTRICTIONS

   The Licensee shall NOT:

   a) Sublicense, resell, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer the Software
      as a standalone product or service;
   b) Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or attribution
      notices in the Software;
   c) Claim authorship or ownership of the original Software;
   d) Use the Software to create a competing product or service that is
      substantially similar in purpose and functionality to FoxML Core;
   e) Permit access to the Software by anyone other than Authorized Users;
   f) Use the Software in any manner that violates applicable law.

4. FEES AND PAYMENT

   Commercial license fees are determined on a per-agreement basis and are
   due as specified in the executed commercial license agreement. All fees
   are non-refundable. Failure to pay fees when due constitutes a material
   breach and grounds for immediate termination.

5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

   a) The Copyright Holder retains all right, title, and interest in and to
      the Software, including all intellectual property rights therein.
   b) The Licensee retains ownership of its own Derivative Works, subject to
      the Copyright Holder's underlying rights in the Software.
   c) The Licensee's models, training outputs, predictions, and trading
      results produced by the Software belong to the Licensee. The Copyright
      Holder claims no rights over the Licensee's data or output.

6. ASSIGNMENT AND CHANGE OF CONTROL

   This license is personal to the Licensee and may not be assigned or
   transferred without the prior written consent of the Copyright Holder,
   which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any change of control of the
   Licensee (including merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all
   assets) shall require the Copyright Holder's written consent for the
   license to continue. Any purported assignment without consent is void.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY

   The Licensee shall treat the Software's source code, architecture,
   algorithms, and any proprietary documentation as confidential information.
   The Licensee shall not disclose such information to any third party except
   to Authorized Users on a need-to-know basis. This obligation survives
   termination of this license.

8. AUDIT RIGHTS

   The Copyright Holder may, upon 30 days' written notice and no more than
   once per calendar year, audit the Licensee's use of the Software to
   verify compliance with this license. The Licensee shall cooperate with
   such audits in good faith. If an audit reveals material non-compliance,
   the Licensee shall bear the reasonable cost of the audit and promptly
   cure the non-compliance or pay the applicable fees.

9. TERMINATION

   a) TERMINATION FOR BREACH: The Copyright Holder may terminate this
      license immediately upon written notice if the Licensee materially
      breaches any term of this license and fails to cure such breach
      within 30 days of receiving written notice of the breach.

   b) TERMINATION FOR NON-PAYMENT: The Copyright Holder may terminate
      this license immediately upon written notice if the Licensee fails
      to pay any fees when due and does not cure such failure within 15
      days of receiving written notice.

   c) EFFECT OF TERMINATION: Upon termination, the Licensee shall
      immediately cease all use of the Software, destroy all copies in
      its possession or control, and certify such destruction in writing
      within 30 days. Termination does not relieve the Licensee of any
      obligation to pay fees accrued prior to termination.

   d) SURVIVAL: Sections 3 (Restrictions), 5 (Intellectual Property),
      7 (Confidentiality), 10 (Enforcement), 11 (Warranty Disclaimer),
      12 (Limitation of Liability), and 13 (Governing Law) shall survive
      termination of this license.

10. ENFORCEMENT AND SETTLEMENT

    a) UNAUTHORIZED USE: If you are found to be using this Software in
       violation of the AGPL-3.0-or-later and without a valid commercial
       license, the Copyright Holder will treat and pursue such use as
       willful copyright infringement under applicable law.

    b) SETTLEMENT OFFER: The Copyright Holder is willing to settle
       unauthorized use claims for:

         (i)   A flat fee of $250,000 USD; PLUS
         (ii)  1% to 10% of gross revenue derived from use of the
               Software, calculated from the date of first unauthorized
               use through the date of settlement. The exact percentage
               shall be determined at the sole discretion of the
               Copyright Holder based on the nature, scope, and duration
               of the unauthorized use.

       This settlement offer is made in good faith and does not limit the
       Copyright Holder's right to pursue all available legal remedies,
       including but not limited to statutory damages under 17 U.S.C.
       Section 504 (up to $150,000 per work infringed for willful
       infringement), injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.

    c) WHISTLEBLOWER BOUNTY: If an individual provides information that
       leads to a successful enforcement action or settlement against an
       unauthorized user of the Software, the Copyright Holder will pay
       that individual a bounty equal to:

         (i)   50% of the flat fee recovered (i.e., $125,000 USD from
               the standard settlement); PLUS
         (ii)  25% of the gross revenue portion recovered (i.e., 25% of
               the 1%-10% gross revenue settlement amount).

       The identity of the reporting individual will be kept strictly
       confidential by the Copyright Holder. This bounty is payable
       within 60 days of the Copyright Holder's receipt of settlement
       funds or damages award. For the avoidance of doubt, this bounty
       applies only to tips that lead to actual monetary recovery.

    d) EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS: To qualify for the whistleblower bounty,
       the reporting individual must provide sufficient evidence to
       substantiate the claim. Acceptable forms of evidence include,
       but are not limited to:

         (i)    Screenshots or recordings of the Software running in
                a production, staging, or development environment at
                the reported organization;
         (ii)   Internal documentation, wikis, Confluence pages, Slack
                messages, emails, or tickets referencing FoxML, FoxML
                Core, or identifiable components of the Software;
         (iii)  Source code, configuration files, or deployment artifacts
                showing integration of the Software (e.g., imports from
                TRAINING/, CONFIG/, LIVE_TRADING/ modules, references to
                FoxML-specific configuration keys or SST helpers);
         (iv)   Git logs, CI/CD pipeline outputs, or container images
                containing the Software or Derivative Works;
         (v)    Job postings, internal presentations, or technical
                specifications that reference the Software by name or
                describe its distinctive architecture (e.g., 3-stage
                intelligent pipeline, deterministic strict mode,
                fingerprint lineage);
         (vi)   Network traffic captures, API responses, or log files
                showing FoxML-specific identifiers, artifact schemas,
                or error messages;
         (vii)  Testimony from current or former employees with direct
                knowledge of the Software's use, supported by at least
                one piece of corroborating documentary evidence.

       The Copyright Holder will evaluate all evidence in good faith.
       Partial or circumstantial evidence may still qualify if, taken
       together, it establishes a reasonable basis for an enforcement
       action. The Copyright Holder is not obligated to pursue every
       report and reserves sole discretion over enforcement decisions.

    e) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS: The Copyright Holder reserves the right to
       pursue claims for unauthorized use for the maximum period permitted
       by applicable law.

    CLAIM.
