2. GRANT OF LICENSE

   Upon execution of a commercial license agreement and payment of all
   applicable fees, the Copyright Holder grants the Licensee a non-exclusive,
   non-transferable (except as set forth in Section 6), worldwide, revocable
   license to:

   a) Use and modify the Software for internal business purposes;
   b) Deploy the Software as part of the Licensee's products and services,
      including network/SaaS deployments, without the source-disclosure
      obligations of the AGPL-3.0;
   c) Distribute the Software solely as an integrated component of the
      Licensee's larger proprietary works (not as a standalone product);
   d) Create Derivative Works for the Licensee's own use and deployment.

3. RESTRICTIONS

   The Licensee shall NOT:

   a) Sublicense, resell, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer the Software
      as a standalone product or service;
   b) Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or attribution
      notices in the Software;

   d) Use the Software to create a competing product or service that is
      substantially similar in purpose and functionality to FoxML Core;
   e) Permit access to the Software by anyone other than Authorized Users;
   f) Use the Software in any manner that violates applicable law.

4. FEES AND PAYMENT

   Commercial license fees are determined on a per-agreement basis and are
   due as specified in the executed commercial license agreement. All fees
   are non-refundable. Failure to pay fees when due constitutes a material
   breach and grounds for immediate termination.

5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

   a) The Copyright Holder retains all right, title, and interest in and to
      the Software, including all intellectual property rights therein.
   b) The Licensee retains ownership of its own Derivative Works, subject to
      the Copyright Holder's underlying rights in the Software.
   c) The Licensee's models, training outputs, predictions, and trading
      results produced by the Software belong to the Licensee. The Copyright
      Holder claims no rights over the Licensee's data or output.

6. ASSIGNMENT AND CHANGE OF CONTROL

   This license is personal to the Licensee and may not be assigned or
   transferred without the prior written consent of the Copyright Holder,
   which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any change of control of the
   Licensee (including merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all
   assets) shall require the Copyright Holder's written consent for the
   license to continue. Any purported assignment without consent is void.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY

   The Licensee shall treat the Software's source code, architecture,
   algorithms, and any proprietary documentation as confidential information.
   The Licensee shall not disclose such information to any third party except
   to Authorized Users on a need-to-know basis. This obligation survives
   termination of this license.

8. AUDIT RIGHTS

   The Copyright Holder may, upon 30 days' written notice and no more than
   once per calendar year, audit the Licensee's use of the Software to
   verify compliance with this license. The Licensee shall cooperate with
   such audits in good faith. If an audit reveals material non-compliance,
   the Licensee shall bear the reasonable cost of the audit and promptly
   cure the non-compliance or pay the applicable fees.

9. TERMINATION

   a) TERMINATION FOR BREACH: The Copyright Holder may terminate this
      license immediately upon written notice if the Licensee materially
      breaches any term of this license and fails to cure such breach
      within 30 days of receiving written notice of the breach.

   b) TERMINATION FOR NON-PAYMENT: The Copyright Holder may terminate
      this license immediately upon written notice if the Licensee fails
      to pay any fees when due and does not cure such failure within 15
      days of receiving written notice.

   c) EFFECT OF TERMINATION: Upon termination, the Licensee shall
      immediately cease all use of the Software, destroy all copies in
      its possession or control, and certify such destruction in writing
      within 30 days. Termination does not relieve the Licensee of any
      obligation to pay fees accrued prior to termination.

   d) SURVIVAL: Sections 3 (Restrictions), 5 (Intellectual Property),
      7 (Confidentiality), 10 (Enforcement), 11 (Warranty Disclaimer),
      12 (Limitation of Liability), and 13 (Governing Law) shall survive
      termination of this license.

10. ENFORCEMENT AND SETTLEMENT

    a) UNAUTHORIZED USE: If you are found to be using this Software in
       violation of the AGPL-3.0-or-later and without a valid commercial
       license, the Copyright Holder will treat and pursue such use as
       willful copyright infringement under applicable law.

    b) SETTLEMENT OFFER: The Copyright Holder is willing to settle
       unauthorized use claims for:

         (i)   A flat fee of $250,000 USD; PLUS
         (ii)  1% to 10% of gross revenue derived from use of the
               Software, calculated from the date of first unauthorized
               use through the date of settlement. The exact percentage
               shall be determined at the sole discretion of the
               Copyright Holder based on the nature, scope, and duration
               of the unauthorized use.

       This settlement offer is made in good faith and does not limit the
       Copyright Holder's right to pursue all available legal remedies,
       including but not limited to statutory damages under 17 U.S.C.
       Section 504 (up to $150,000 per work infringed for willful
       infringement), injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.

    c) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS: The Copyright Holder reserves the right to
       pursue claims for unauthorized use for the maximum period permitted
       by applicable law.

11. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
    THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
    ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

    THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY APPLICATION
    WHERE FAILURE COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE
    FINANCIAL LOSS. THE LICENSEE ASSUMES ALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH USE
    OF THE SOFTWARE IN TRADING, INVESTMENT, OR OTHER FINANCIAL APPLICATIONS.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,

    OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
    TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE
    USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER HAS BEEN ADVISED
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS LICENSE
    SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY THE LICENSEE DURING THE
    12-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE
    CLAIM.

13. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

    This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
    the laws of the United States of America and the State of Texas,
    without regard to conflict of law principles.

    Any dispute arising out of or relating to this license shall be
    resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in
    Travis County, Texas. The Licensee consents to the personal
    jurisdiction of such courts.

14. SEVERABILITY

    If any provision of this license is held to be invalid, illegal, or
    unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force
    and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum
    extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving
    its original intent.

15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

    This license, together with any executed commercial license agreement,
    constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
    the Software and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations,
